##The Witness

This is an attempt to solve puzzles from [The Witness](http://the-witness.net/)
with a programming language that I am in the process of creating called
[Sentient](http://sentient-lang.org/).

##Initial thoughts

Sentient is good at layering constraints. I plan to begin by describing what it
means for a path to be valid and then extend this to include the rules for the
different puzzle types.

##How to run

Install Sentient:

```
npm install -g sentient-lang
```

Run the program:

```
sentient the_witness.snt -n 0
```
